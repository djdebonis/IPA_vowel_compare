The International Phonetic Alphabet, also known as IPA, is a standardized phonetic alphabet that translates pronunciation orthographically across any language.

In short, the prescriptive IPA strings are what 'should be' said by fluent speakers of the language (according to standards), whereas descriptive strings are what are actually said (in this case by English speakers acquiring the Spanish language).
